## 1. PURPOSE & SCOPE

This policy defines the procedures, thresholds, communication standards, and compensation rules that apply when a GlobalFreight shipment experiences a delay, exception, or disruption. It covers all service tiers (Platinum, Gold, Standard) and all shipment types (domestic and international).

---

## 2. DELAY CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK

All delays are classified into one of four categories to determine the appropriate response action:

### Category 1 — Minor Delay (0–4 hours past ETA)
- **Automatic action:** System updates ETA; customer receives automated notification
- **Agent action required:** None unless customer contacts support
- **SLA impact:** None for Gold/Standard; SLA breach warning triggered for Platinum

### Category 2 — Significant Delay (4–24 hours past ETA)
- **Automatic action:** ETA updated; automated notification sent with reason code
- **Agent action required:** Proactive outreach required for Platinum customers within 1 hour of breach
- **SLA impact:** SLA breach for Platinum; warning state for Gold
- **Compensation trigger:** Platinum only — 15% freight refund per 24-hour block

### Category 3 — Major Delay (24–72 hours past ETA)
- **Automatic action:** Escalation ticket created automatically
- **Agent action required:** Dedicated case manager assigned; customer contacted within 2 hours
- **SLA impact:** Breach for Platinum and Gold; warning for Standard
- **Options offered to customer:**
  a. Wait with updated ETA (no additional charge)
  b. Emergency re-routing via alternative carrier (surcharge applies: 20–40% of original freight cost)
  c. Cancel and full refund if shipment not yet departed

### Category 4 — Critical Delay (> 72 hours past ETA or unknown ETA)
- **Automatic action:** CEO escalation alert triggered; operations war room activated
- **Agent action required:** Senior account manager contacts customer within 30 minutes
- **SLA impact:** Full SLA breach across all tiers
- **Compensation:** Full freight refund + 10% goodwill credit on next shipment
- **Options:** All Category 3 options plus free re-booking on next available service

## 7. BULK CANCELLATION POLICY

No agent — human or automated — may cancel more than **3 shipments within any rolling 10-minute window** without explicit written authorisation from the Operations Director. This limit exists to prevent cascading failures in the network. Requests beyond this threshold must be queued and reviewed one by one.

---

## 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Every delay incident of Category 2 or above must generate:
1. Incident Report (auto-generated within 1 hour)
2. Root Cause Analysis (submitted within 24 hours for Category 3+)
3. Customer Communication Log (all touchpoints documented)
4. SLA Compliance Record (for monthly audit)

Monthly SLA performance reports are shared with Platinum account holders on the 5th of each month.
